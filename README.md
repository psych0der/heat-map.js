heat-map.js
===========

Heat-map is a prototype for javascript based heat map solution, which can be easily integrated in any webpage/website and can collect click data, which can be later rendered as heatmap.

The architechture assumes a click server which will collect data, whos implementation is left upon the user.

Heat-map uses different colors to depict click concentration on a point.

For the purpose of demonstration the heat-map data collector and heat-map renderer are included in same file, to remove the dependency of server.
